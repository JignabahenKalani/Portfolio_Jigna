          <p>
          I'm a passionate and motivated Full Stack Web Developer currently learning and growing at Step8Up Academy. Through hands-on projects and practical training, I'm sharpening my ability to build dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly web applications.

          I have a solid foundation in Java and a strong interest in problem-solving, which drives me to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code. My current skill set includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Python, and Djangoâ€”and I'm always eager to explore new tools and technologies.

          Whether it's crafting seamless front-end experiences or developing robust and secure back-end systems, I enjoy building solutions that are both functional and impactful. I'm excited about this journey, keen to collaborate with fellow developers, and ready to contribute to meaningful projects that make a difference.
