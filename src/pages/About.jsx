          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I’m a passionate and motivated Full Stack Web Developer who has recently completed a course at Step8Up Academy. Through hands-on projects and practical training, I’ve developed strong skills in building dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly web applications.</p>
          <p>I have a solid foundation in Java and a keen interest in problem-solving, which drives me to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code. My skill set includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Python, and Django, and I’m always eager to explore new tools and technologies.</p>
          <p>During my course, I worked on several projects, including a collaborative Travel Blog, a React-based portfolio website, and an NGO website, which helped me gain practical experience in both front-end and back-end development.</p>
          <p> I enjoy working across the full stack and whether crafting smooth front-end experiences or building secure and scalable back-end systems. Having completed my course, I’m now looking forward to collaborating with other developers and contributing to impactful projects.</p>
